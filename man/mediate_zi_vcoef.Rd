\arguments{
\item{model.u}{A fitted model object for confounder. Can be of class 'lm',
'polr', 'bayespolr', 'glm', 'bayesglm', 'gam', 'rq', or 'survreg'.}

\item{delta.beta.u}{Sensitivity parameter as difference from the estimated
treatment coefficient in the confounder model (model.u) based on the
observed data.}

\item{model.m}{A fitted model object for mediator.  Can be of class 'lm',
'polr', 'bayespolr', 'glm', 'bayesglm', 'gam', 'rq', or 'survreg'.}

\item{model.y}{A fitted model object for outcome.  Can be of class 'lm',
'polr', 'bayespolr', 'glm', 'bayesglm', 'gam', 'vglm', 'rq', 'survreg',
or 'zeroinfl'}

\item{sims}{Number of Monte Carlo draws for nonparametric bootstrap or
quasi-Bayesian approximation.}

\item{boot}{A logical value. if 'FALSE' a quasi-Bayesian approximation is
used for confidence intervals; if 'TRUE' nonparametric bootstrap will be
used. Default is 'FALSE'.}

\item{treat}{A character string indicating the name of the treatment variable
used in the models.  The treatment can be either binary (integer or a
two-valued factor) or continuous (numeric).}

\item{mediator}{A character string indicating the name of the mediator
variable used in the models.}

\item{confounder}{A character string indicating the name of the confounder
variable used in the models.}

\item{covariates}{A list or data frame containing values for a subset of the
pre-treatment covariates in 'model.m' and 'model.y'. If provided, the
function will return the estimates conditional on those covariate values.}

\item{outcome}{A character string indicating the name of the outcome variable
in `model.y'. Only necessary if 'model.y' is of class 'survreg'; otherwise
ignored.}

\item{control}{A character string indicating the name of the control group
indicator. Only relevant if 'model.y' is of class 'gam'. If provided, 'd0',
'z0' and 'n0' are allowed to differ from 'd1', 'z1' and 'n1', respectively.}

\item{conf.level}{Level of the returned two-sided confidence intervals.
Default is to return the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the simulated
quantities.}

\item{control.value}{Value of the treatment variable used as the control
condition. Default is 0.}

\item{treat.value}{Value of the treatment variable used as the treatment
condition. Default is 1.}

\item{long}{A logical value. If 'TRUE', the output will contain the entire
sets of simulation draws of the the average causal mediation effects,
direct effects, proportions mediated, and total effect. Default is 'TRUE'.}

\item{dropobs}{A logical value indicating the behavior when the model frames
of 'model.m' and 'model.y' (and the 'cluster' variable if included) are
composed of different observations. If 'TRUE', models will be re-fitted
using common data rows. If 'FALSE', error is returned. Default is 'FALSE'.}

\item{robustSE}{A logical value. If 'TRUE', heteroskedasticity-consistent
standard errors will be used in quasi-Bayesian simulations. Ignored if
'boot' is 'TRUE' or neither 'model.m' nor 'model.y' has a method for
\code{vcovHC} in the \code{sandwich} package. Default is 'FALSE'.}

\item{cluster}{A variable indicating clusters for standard errors. Note that
this should be a vector of cluster indicators itself, not a character
string for the name of the variable.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to \code{vcovHC} in the \code{sandwich}
package: typically the 'type' argument, which is ignored if 'robustSE' is
'FALSE'. Arguments to the \code{boot} in the \code{boot} package may also
be passed, e.g. 'parallel' and 'ncpus'.}

\code{mediate_zi_vcoef} returns an object of class "\code{mediate}", (or
  "\code{mediate.order}" if the outcome model used is 'polr' or 'bayespolr'),

  are not available if 'long' is set to 'FALSE' by the user.

  The function \code{summary} (i.e., \code{summary.mediate},
  or \code{summary.mediate.order}) can be used to obtain a table of the
  results.  The function \code{plot} (i.e., \code{plot.mediate}, or
  \code{plot.mediate.order}) can be used to produce a plot of the estimated
  average causal mediation, average direct, and total effects along with
  their confidence intervals.

  the control and treatment conditions.}

\description{
\loadmathjax{} 'mediate_zi_vcoef' is modified from \code{mediate_zi} function with 3
confounder-related parameters ('model.u', 'delta.beta.u', and 'confounder')
added. It is used to estimate causal mediation effects when there is a
treatment-induced mediator-outcome confounder, and the coefficient of treatment
in the confounder model is specified by users. Users can perform sensitivity
analysis with a range of specified coefficient values when there is a
post-treatment confounder.
