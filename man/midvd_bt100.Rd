A bootstrap random subsample of the DDHP MI-DVD trial data used in Cheng, J.,
Cheng, N.F., Guo, Z., Gregorich, S., Ismail, A.I., Gansky, S.A. (2018).
In the trial, the enrolled families were examined at Wave 1 (randomization),
wave 2 (dental examination and study started, considered as baseline),
6-month follow up, and end of the study (wave 3, 2-year). This bootstrap
subsample data contain 100 rows and 9 columns with no missing values.
