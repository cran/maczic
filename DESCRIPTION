Description: Performs causal mediation analysis for count and zero-inflated
    count data without or with a post-treatment confounder; calculates power
    to detect prespecified causal mediation effects, direct effects, and 
    total effects; performs sensitivity analysis when there is a treatment-
    induced mediator-outcome confounder as described by Cheng, J., Cheng, N.F., 
    Guo, Z., Gregorich, S., Ismail, A.I., Gansky, S.A. (2018) 
    <doi:10.1177/0962280216686131>. Implements Instrumental Variable (IV) 
    method to estimate the controlled (natural) direct and mediation effects, 
    and compute the bootstrap Confidence Intervals as described by Guo, Z., 
    Small, D.S., Gansky, S.A., Cheng, J. (2018) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12233>.
